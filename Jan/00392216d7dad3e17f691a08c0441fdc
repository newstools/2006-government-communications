25 January 2006The Extended Cabinet meeting in Pretoria today (Wednesday) honoured the memory of Dr Anton Rupert as his funeral was taking place in the Cape. Mr Trevor Manuel, Minister of Finance, was mandated to be the Government's representative at the occasion. The Lekgotla took the opportunity of the combined presence of other Cabinet members, Deputy Ministers, Premiers and Directors-General to send a combined message of condolence and support to the Rupert family. The President and other Lekgotla participants, in recognising and celebrating Dr Rupert's life, said: "Anton Rupert and the remarkable role he played in the South African economy were very much in mind as we tackled difficult issues in the field in which he had such a sustained interest - business and economic development. "His life and service to South Africa must remain an inspiration for us in relation to the work we still have to do in building a better South Africa for all. The Cabinet Lekgotla joins the rest of South Africa in extending condolences to his family and next-of-kin."
