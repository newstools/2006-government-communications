6 December 2006In response to media enquiries concerning the Integrated Coastal Management Bill which was approved by Cabinet for public comment, details of the contents of the bill will be communicated by the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism on Sunday.In the meanwhile, GCIS would like to clarify that the bill will not deal with the matter of foreign ownership of land as stated in the post-Cabinet media briefing today. The bill will address issues of integrated development of coastal areas to ensure that development occurs in an orderly way and does not limit public access to the coast.Enquiries Themba Maseko Cell: 083 645 0810Issued by: Government Communications (GCIS)
